                                <h2>Figurine</h2>
                                <p>I designed the logo for Figurine; a company that manufactures test dolls, better known as "Crash Dummies."</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-2">
                                <img src="img/project-figurine.PNG" alt="Thumbnail of finished project slide" width="70%">
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-2">
                                <p>My goal was to design a logo that was simple, unique, impactful (pun-intended),and most importantly, memorable. I knew right away that I wanted to design my logo with the silhouette of a doll in mind. The problem was adhering to the aforementioned qualities that I wanted to achieve while still working around my initial inspiration.</p>
                                <p>The following are sketches in which I first brainstormed words describing the company and their products. I then moved on to playing around with rough typefonts, and anatomy that I can model my logo on.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-2">
                                <img src="img/project-draft-1.jpg" alt="Sketches of potential logo and typefont ideas" width="70%"> 
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-2">
                                <p>After some consideration regarding dimensions and scaling, I decided to work with the profile of a human head. I decided that the head is a recognizable figure that can be efficiently resized on many different formats, and can be unique if designed effectively.</p>
                                <p>Using a template profile as a reference, I reshaped the silhouette I had until it was more robotic and emotionless in caricature. I was satisfied with the result and shifted towards finding a suitable typeface for the logo.</p>
